    "Now that we have learned about feature engineering, cross validation, and grid search, let's test all your new skills with a project exercise in Machine Learning. This exercise will have a more guided approach, later on the ML projects will begin to be more open-ended. We'll start off with using the final version of the Ames Housing dataset we worked on through the feature engineering section of the course. Your goal will be to create a Linear Regression Model, train it on the data with the optimal parameters using a grid search, and then evaluate the model's capabilities on a test set."
